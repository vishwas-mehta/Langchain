# Week 3 - GCP Cloud Functions Assignment

## Overview
This project implements a Google Cloud Function that automatically analyzes text files uploaded to Cloud Storage, identifies the longest line(s), and saves the results back to the bucket.

---

## Files Included

### 1. **main.py**
- Cloud Function code that triggers on file uploads to GCS
- Downloads the file, finds longest line(s) by character length
- Logs results to Cloud Logging
- Saves analysis as `result_<filename>.txt` back to the bucket
- Includes logic to prevent infinite loops

### 2. **requirements.txt**
- Python dependencies for the Cloud Function
- Contains: `google-cloud-storage` and `functions-framework`

### 3. **textfile.txt**
- Sample input file used for testing the function

### 4. **result_textfile.txt**
- Example output file generated by the Cloud Function
- Shows total lines, max line length, and all longest lines

### 5. **Screenshots**
- **logs_screenshot**: Shows Cloud Logging output during function execution
- **function_details_screenshot**: Shows deployed Cloud Function configuration in GCP Console

## How It Works

1. Upload a text file to GCS bucket `week3_ibd`
2. Cloud Function automatically triggers via Eventarc
3. Function analyzes the file and finds longest line(s)
4. Results are printed to Cloud Logging
5. Output saved as `result_<filename>.txt` in the same bucket
